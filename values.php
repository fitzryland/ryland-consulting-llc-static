	<p>I evaluate each prospective partner’s mission, operations, and leadership for the capacity and willingness to pursue the following values. When we embody these values together, we give ourselves the greatest chance for success.</p>

	<h3 class="slideHead arrowUp">Societal Benefit</h3>

	<p>Each of my clients pursues a clear mission to benefit society, enabling us to improve our world by realizing a shared vision.</p>

	<h3 class="slideHead arrowUp">Community Commitment</h3>

	<p>Engaging the community and earning its support are essential to an organization’s grant fundraising success. When the community believes in you, grantmakers notice.</p>

	<h3 class="slideHead arrowUp">Integrity</h3>

	<p>In philanthropy today, establishing realistic goals, maintaining reliable data, and pursuing clear objectives are hallmarks of a sustainable nonprofit enterprise.</p>

	<h3 class="slideHead arrowUp">Transparency</h3>

	<p>Cultivating the trust of the people and institutions that make nonprofit agencies successful is key to growth and long-term viability. I advocate for open and honest communication with staff, supporters, and the community.</p>

	<h3 class="slideHead arrowUp">Accessibility</h3>

	<p>Reliable access to an organization’s decision-makers can make all the difference, whether we’re brainstorming a proposal or racing to a deadline.</p>
