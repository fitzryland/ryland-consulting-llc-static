	<h2>Relationships, not just proposals.</h2>
	<p>Personal relationships are the foundation of Ryland Consulting. When you partner with Ryland Consulting, <a href="experience.php">I am your grant writer</a>. I have secured more than $20 million in grant awards for a diverse set of causes, from environmental conservation to family violence prevention, cultivating an impressive <a href="experience.php#success">Success Rate</a>. I have the experience, knowledge, and skill necessary to grow and sustain your grant fundraising strategy.</p>
	<h2>Ryland Consulting is different.</h2>
	<p>There are many grant writing consultant firms out there. The majority of those firms simply dish out grant writing jobs to a web of contractors and take a finder’s fee off the top of each project. I call these operations <a href="pricing.php#RylandConsultingVsTheProposalFactory">“proposal factories”</a> because agencies engage them simply to churn out proposals, working with a different grant writer each time, and never building a long-term partnership.</p>
	<h2>Strong partnerships, successful proposals.</h2>
	<p>My goal is to establish and maintain productive, collaborative partnerships with clients, building trust through accountability, honesty, and achievement. By laying a strong foundation with Ryland Consulting ahead of time, you can count on me to act quickly and confidently at the first recognition of a grant opportunity.</p>
