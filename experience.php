	<p>I am William Ryland, the founder and sole member of Ryland Consulting. When you hire Ryland Consulting, I will personally work with you.</p>

	<p>Since graduating from Tulane University with <span class="caption">Cum laude</span> honors in English, I have devoted myself to raising funds for worthy non-profit agencies across the country. Fresh out of college, as an in-house grant writer for a small local organization, I was able to increase annual grant revenue by over 50% in two years.</p>

	<p>Equipped with successful experience winning grants from government and foundation sources, I moved with my fianc&#233; to California in 2009, where a mid-sized non-profit immediately recognized my gifts and hired me as a grant writer. Again, I succeeded in reaching my goals, this time in the midst of an extremely difficult economic and fundraising environment.</p>

	<p>The experience of running the grant writing operations of two very different organizations has prepared me to manage complex grant strategies successfully.</p>

	<p>Throughout my career as an in-house grant writer, I also maintained a consistent consulting clientele, securing grants for a wide array of agencies. I have now raised more than $20 million for a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from domestic violence shelters to sea turtle rehabilitation. This broad and deep experience has prepared me to excel as a fundraiser for almost any charitable cause.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="underline">About Success Rates:</span> Many grant writers do not show their success rates because they present a necessarily incomplete picture. Whether or not a proposal receives funding depends on many factors, only one of which is the quality of the written proposal. Most grant writing consultants arenâ€™t involved in laying the groundwork, swooping in just to write the proposal.</p>

<p class="caption">A successful proposal is the result of a process, not just a writing exercise. I work with each client to navigate the many variables that determine whether or not a proposal will receive funding. I show my success rates because they reflect the strength of the strategies that I develop and carry out with my clients.</p>

<p class="caption">Still, I present these charts as an accurate record of my past work, <span class="underline">not</span> as a promise of future results. We will approach the process thoroughly, but in the end, we will not have control over every variable.</p>
